      <h1>Competitive Climbing Team</h1><br>

      <p>The Washington University Climbing Team is a group of serious climbers looking to improve their climbing ability. There is no skill requirement to join the team, but you must be willing to attend scheduled practices twice a week, and ideally climb outside of practice at least once a week. In return for your dedication and effort, you will be able to climb regularly with some of the best climbers in the St. Louis area, along with many people of similar skill level.</p>

      <p>The climbing team participates in many climbing competitions over the course of a school year. In the fall, many bouldering competitions are available to the team members, and the team will partially reimburse the entry fee for all members. In the spring, we switch gears and start competing in roped climbing, and preparing for outdoor sends.</p>

      <p>Climbing with the team requires dedication and focus, but also affords you many opportunities to learn from other serious climbers and to push your limits as a climber.</p>

      <p>Interested?</p><br>

      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full membership (Climb So Ill for fall semester and Upper Limits for spring semester)</li>
        <li>Willingness to attend two regular practices each week</li>
        <li>An intense desire to improve as a climber</li>
      </ul><br>
